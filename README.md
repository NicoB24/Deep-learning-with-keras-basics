# Deep Learning with Keras (basics)

This repository includes two jupyter notebooks. In the first one, i will create a classification model using multilayer perceptron with backpropagation to predict
if a person will have a heart disease or not. In the second one i will use the famous MNIST dataset, to train another classification model, to create a simple
image classificator.

To run this notebooks, use [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
